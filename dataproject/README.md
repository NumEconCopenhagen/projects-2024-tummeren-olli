# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **Uneployment based on different unemployment insurance funds in Denmark**.
This project aims to show the difference in unemployment throughout different unemployment insurance funds of Denmark. 
In the later analysis this project also groups the different unemployment insurance funds by the professions, to see which of the 
groups has the highest share in pct. of total unemployment. 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

We apply the **following datasets**:

We use data from DstApi, more specifically we use the data from the following link:

This is the table called: AUL01, which is also shown in our .ipynb file. 

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install matplotlib-venn``
``pip install git+https://github.com/alemartinello/dstapi``
