# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **Solow model with human capital**.
We have chosen the Solow model with human capital as our base model. 
We have set up this model in our py.file and called in in the ipynb.file. 
We solve the model for the SS and then extend the model by introducing that savings in human capital will increase by a factor every yaer,
which will change the steady state values for both y_tilde and k_tilde. 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
