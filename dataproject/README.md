# Data analysis project

This project aims to analyze unemployment trends across various unemployment insurance funds (A-kasse) in Denmark. By examining the data, we highlight the differences in unemployment rates among these funds. Additionally, we categorize these insurance funds by professions to identify which groups contribute the most to the overall unemployment.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb) which uses functions from dataproject.py.

We apply the **following datasets**:

We use data from DstApi, more specifically we use the data from the following link: 
https://www.statistikbanken.dk/statbank5a/default.asp?w=1920
This is the table called: AUL01, which is also shown in our .ipynb file. 

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install git+https://github.com/alemartinello/dstapi``
``pip install pandas-datareader``
