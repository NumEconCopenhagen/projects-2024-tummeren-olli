# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **Uneployment rate in different areas in Denmark**.
This project aims to show the difference in unemployment rates throughout different areas of Denmark. 
In the later analysis this project also looks at the unemployment rate in different areas at the same time as other variables. 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

We apply the **following datasets**:

We use data from DstApi, more specifically we use the data from the following link: 
https://www.statistikbanken.dk/statbank5a/default.asp?w=1920
This is the table called: AUL01, which is also shown in our .ipynb file. 

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install matplotlib-venn``
